# Efficiency_Calculator
Objective: Visualize how packing density affects cost of shipping.  This program creates a range of widths, depths, and heights given initial medians. Every combination of W x D x H is created and then--using constants for packaging and shipping container dimensions--the total shipping dimensions are determined for every W x D x H combination. The number of containers that can fit per W x D x H of the shipping container  is calculated. The cost of shipping each m^2 of mirror is calculated and  then visualized. Give a concise output of dimensions: best range for cost and best range for volume efficiency.
